  CodeYourFuture is a non-profit organization that supports refugees and people from disadvantaged backgrounds to become tech professionals. This community-driven organization provides a comprehensive web development program that covers essential technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. The mission of CYF is to break down barriers and create equal opportunities for everyone in the tech industry. Students learn not only technical skills but also soft skills like teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. Volunteers from the tech industry dedicate their time to mentor students and guide them through their learning journey. It is a supportive community where everyone works together to build a better future through education and technology. I am currently learning the basics of web development through their platform, starting with simple HTML and CSS exercises. This course is a great step toward starting a new career in the digital world.
